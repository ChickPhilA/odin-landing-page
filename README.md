# odin-landing-page
The purpose of this project is to practice and utilize the foundations of CSS Flexbox that I learned through The Odin Project's foundations curriculum

With all of the skills I've learned through the Flexbox section, I made a project to play around and apply FLexbox to make an actual landing page (per the example that TOP provided for us). Go check out The Odin Project—— a highly valuable learning resource!
